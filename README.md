# Game of thrones 

Game of Thrones App is an iOS application built entirely with UIKit programmatically.
The app allows users to view character information from the Game of Thrones series by fetching data from a REST API.
It includes a search bar for filtering characters and is developed using the MVVM architecture, Combine, and unit tests for logic validation.
